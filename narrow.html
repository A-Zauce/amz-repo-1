        <h1>General Sherman Stopped Too Soon</h1>
        <p>During the US Civil War, General William Tecumseh Sherman burned Georgia to the ground.</p>
        <p>He should have taken his job seriously, made a left turn, and paved a sixty-mile-wide path out of the South.</p>
        <p>The fact that he didn't burn all of South Carolina, traitorous as they were, is a tragedy.</p>
        <p>His army should have paved a path back to D.C. through Richmond.</p>
